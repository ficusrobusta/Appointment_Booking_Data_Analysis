# Go_Instore_Data_Analysis

# Background

At Go Instore we want to understand the impact of new features on our customer base, in as much detail as possible. As we attempt to build new channels to connect the in store to the online we develop new products and build on existing features. One of these new products is referred to as ‘One to One Appointments Booking’, which is a pre-booking system designed to schedule Go Instore calls in advance. Customers can book, cancel or modify their booking prior to the scheduled launch of the 2 way video call.

# The task

Imagine you have been asked to give a 15 minute presentation to Go Instore’s senior leadership team. You have been asked to report on the performance of the new Appointments channel.

1. How has the new Appointment feature performed overall? What are the key takeaways?
2. What variables contribute to successful and converting Appointments? Are there any pitfalls evident in the data? How could the service be improved? How could we better inform our clients to help them use the service better?

# The data

We have provided you with a fictional sample of Appointment data csv with a field
description explainer attached in an excel.

# What we are looking for from you:

In this test we are looking for you to:
- Manipulate data to draw insights & then communicate these insights effectively to senior
non-technical colleagues
● Consider and deal with ‘edge cases’ or ‘irregularities’ in the data
● Present your findings in a clear and concise manner relevant to briefings for senior
executives
● Discuss what you’d do next, such as what other data would you have liked to bring this
research to life more

# Tips for completing the test:

● You can undertake the analysis using whichever tools or techniques you like (e.g. R, Python, Power BI, Excel etc..). We suggest you use the tools you are most familiar and comfortable with.
● The output of your work should be appropriate for your imaginary audience (eg. Go Instore’s Senior Leadership Team).
● Don’t over complicate it.
